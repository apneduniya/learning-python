## 1. What are the Logical operators available in Python state with example? (2)

Python provides three logical operators:
- `and`: Returns True if both statements are true.
- `or`: Returns True if at least one statement is true.
- `not`: Reverses the result, returns False if the result is true.

**Example:**
```python
x = 5
y = 10
print(x > 0 and y > 0)  # True
print(x > 0 or y < 0)   # True
print(not(x > 0))       # False
```

> "Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements."

---

## 2. State with an example, the role of the following operators:
### i) `is`  ii) `in`  iii) `not in`  iv) `<<`  v) `>>` (5)

- `is`: Checks if two variables refer to the same object.
  ```python
  a = [1, 2]
  b = a
  print(a is b)  # True
  ```
- `in`: Checks if a value exists in a sequence.
  ```python
  print(3 in [1, 2, 3])  # True
  ```
- `not in`: Checks if a value does not exist in a sequence.
  ```python
  print(4 not in [1, 2, 3])  # True
  ```
- `<<`: Bitwise left shift operator.
  ```python
  print(2 << 2)  # 8 (2*2^2)
  ```
- `>>`: Bitwise right shift operator.
  ```python
  print(8 >> 2)  # 2 (8/2^2)
  ```

> "The `is` operator checks identity, not equality. `in` and `not in` are used for membership tests. `<<` and `>>` are used for bitwise operations."

---

## 3. Describe if-elif-else structure with an example. (5)

The `if-elif-else` structure is used for multi-way decision making in Python.

**Syntax:**
```python
if condition1:
    # code block
elif condition2:
    # code block
else:
    # code block
```

**Example:**
```python
num = 10
if num > 0:
    print("Positive")
elif num == 0:
    print("Zero")
else:
    print("Negative")
```

> "Use `elif` for multiple conditions. Only the first true condition's block is executed."

---

## 4. Take an age and find if he or she is Child or Teenage or Adult or Senior Citizen. (5)

**Program:**
```python
age = int(input("Enter age: "))
if age < 13:
    print("Child")
elif age < 20:
    print("Teenage")
elif age < 60:
    print("Adult")
else:
    print("Senior Citizen")
```

---

## 5. Take a year and find leap year or not. (5)

**Program:**
```python
year = int(input("Enter year: "))
if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):
    print("Leap Year")
else:
    print("Not a Leap Year")
```

> "A leap year is divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400."

---

## 6. The marks obtained by a student in 3 different subjects are input through the keyboard. The student gets a division as per the following rules:
- Percentage >= 60: First division
- Percentage 50-59: Second division
- Percentage 40-49: Third division
- Percentage < 40: Fail
Write a program to calculate the division obtained by the student. (5)

**Program:**
```python
marks1 = float(input("Enter marks for subject 1: "))
marks2 = float(input("Enter marks for subject 2: "))
marks3 = float(input("Enter marks for subject 3: "))
percentage = (marks1 + marks2 + marks3) / 3
if percentage >= 60:
    print("First division")
elif percentage >= 50:
    print("Second division")
elif percentage >= 40:
    print("Third division")
else:
    print("Fail")
```

---

## 7. Describe range() function with an example. (3)

The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers, commonly used in loops.

**Example:**
```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
# Output: 1 2 3 4 5
```

> "range(start, stop, step) generates numbers from start to stop-1, incremented by step."

---

## 8. Write a program to print all odd non-prime numbers between 1 to 50. (5)

**Program:**
```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
for i in range(1, 51):
    if i % 2 != 0 and not is_prime(i):
        print(i, end=' ')
```

---

## 9. Calculates the sum of digits of a number. (5)

**Program:**
```python
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
sum_digits = 0
while num > 0:
    sum_digits += num % 10
    num //= 10
print("Sum of digits:", sum_digits)
```

---

## 10. Print the following pattern for n=4: (5)
```
1
22
333
4444
```
**Program:**
```python
n = 4
for i in range(1, n+1):
    print(str(i) * i)
```

---

## 11. Write a program to calculate the sum of the following series: (5)
S = 1/2 + 2/3 + 3/4 + ... + n/(n+1) [n should be user input]

**Program:**
```python
n = int(input("Enter n: "))
sum_series = 0
for i in range(1, n+1):
    sum_series += i / (i+1)
print("Sum of series:", sum_series)
```

---

## 12. Difference between break and continue with example. (5)

- `break`: Exits the loop completely.
- `continue`: Skips the current iteration and continues with the next.

**Example:**
```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)  # Output: 1 2

for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)  # Output: 1 2 4 5
```

> "Use `break` to exit a loop early, `continue` to skip to the next iteration."

---

## 13. Define a function which will take principal amount, time in years and rate of interest in percentage as input and calculate the simple interest. All the three arguments have default values â€“ 1000 (principal amount), 5 (time in years) and 10 (rate of interest in percentage). Call the function from main module with all possible ways and calculate the simple interest each time. (5)

**Program:**
```python
def simple_interest(principal=1000, time=5, rate=10):
    return (principal * time * rate) / 100

# Calling with all default values
print(simple_interest())
# Calling with one argument
print(simple_interest(2000))
# Calling with two arguments
print(simple_interest(2000, 3))
# Calling with all arguments
print(simple_interest(2000, 3, 8))
```
> "Default arguments allow a function to be called with fewer arguments than it is defined to accept."

---

## 14. Define a function which will calculate factorial of a number and call the function from main module with a value taken from user. (5)

**Program:**
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        result *= i
    return result

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print("Factorial:", factorial(num))
```

---

## 15. Define a function which will accept name of a student and a set of sports that he/she likes and this function will display the student name and his/her favorite sports. Use variable length argument in the function parameter so that different student can have different number of favorite sports. (5)

**Program:**
```python
def fav_sports(name, *sports):
    print("Student Name:", name)
    print("Favorite Sports:", ', '.join(sports))

fav_sports("Amit", "Cricket", "Football")
fav_sports("Sara", "Tennis")
```
> "The *args syntax allows a function to accept any number of positional arguments."

---

## 16. What is function? What is the advantage and disadvantage of using function? (2+2+2)

- **Function:** A function is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be reused.
- **Advantages:**
  - Code reusability
  - Modularity
  - Easier debugging and maintenance
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Overuse can make code harder to follow
  - Function calls add overhead

> "Functions help organize code, but too many small functions can reduce readability."

---

## 17. Using lambda function to check whether a number is Positive, negative or zero. (3)

**Program:**
```python
check = lambda x: "Positive" if x > 0 else ("Negative" if x < 0 else "Zero")
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print(check(num))
```

---

## 18. Using lambda function to check whether the number is even or odd (3)

**Program:**
```python
even_odd = lambda x: "Even" if x % 2 == 0 else "Odd"
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print(even_odd(num))
```

---

## 19. What is the role of return and def keyword with respect to function? (2)

- `def`: Used to define a function in Python.
- `return`: Used to exit a function and return a value to the caller.

> "The `def` keyword starts a function definition. The `return` keyword sends a result back to where the function was called."

---

## 20. Define recursion. Differentiate it with iteration. (2+3)

- **Recursion:** When a function calls itself to solve a problem.
- **Difference:**
  - Recursion solves a problem by breaking it into smaller subproblems, calling itself.
  - Iteration uses loops to repeat code until a condition is met.
  - Recursion can be more elegant but may use more memory due to function call stack.

> "Recursion is best for problems that can be divided into similar subproblems."

---

## 21. Write a python program to print Fibonacci series using recursion (5)

**Program:**
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

n = int(input("Enter number of terms: "))
for i in range(n):
    print(fibonacci(i), end=' ')
```

---

## 22. Write a python program to print Factorial using recursion (5)

**Program:**
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print("Factorial:", factorial(num))
```

---

```python
def sum_digits(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return n % 10 + sum_digits(n // 10)

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print("Sum of digits:", sum_digits(num))
```

---

## 24. Difference between class and object. (3)

- **Class:** A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines attributes and methods.
- **Object:** An instance of a class. It represents a specific entity with values assigned to the attributes defined by the class.

> "A class is like a blueprint, and an object is like a house built from that blueprint."

---

## 25. Define the following: a) Abstraction b) Encapsulation (3+3)

- **Abstraction:** Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.
  > "Abstraction helps in reducing programming complexity and effort."
- **Encapsulation:** Wrapping up data and methods into a single unit (class) and restricting access to some of the object's components.
  > "Encapsulation is implemented using private and public access specifiers."

---

## 26. What is inheritance? Advantages of Inheritance. Types of Inheritance. (2+2+3)

- **Inheritance:** The process by which one class (child) acquires the properties and behaviors (methods) of another class (parent).
- **Advantages:**
  - Code reusability
  - Method overriding
  - Easier code maintenance
- **Types of Inheritance:**
  - Single Inheritance
  - Multiple Inheritance
  - Multilevel Inheritance
  - Hierarchical Inheritance
  - Hybrid Inheritance

(5)

**Program:**
```python
class Account:
    count = 0  # Class variable
    def __init__(self, name, acc_no, balance):
        self.name = name
        self.acc_no = acc_no
        self.balance = balance
        Account.count += 1
    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount <= self.balance:
            self.balance -= amount
        else:
            print("Insufficient balance")
    def check_balance(self):
        print(f"Balance for {self.name}: {self.balance}")

# Creating objects
acc1 = Account("Amit", 101, 5000)
acc2 = Account("Sara", 102, 3000)
acc1.deposit(1000)
acc2.withdraw(500)
acc1.check_balance()
acc2.check_balance()
print("Total accounts created:", Account.count)
```

s2 = Student("Sara", 2, 90)
s1.display()
s2.display()
```

---

## 29. Frame a base class Person which contains object variable name and age of a person. It should have a display_person() method which will display details of a person.

Student class should contain display_student() method which will display student record and Teacher class should contain display_teacher() method which will display teacher record. Write a program in python to test the above classes. (10)

**Program:**
```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    def display_person(self):
        print(f"Name: {self.name}, Age: {self.age}")

class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, age, roll, marks):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.roll = roll
        self.marks = marks
    def display_student(self):
        self.display_person()
        print(f"Roll: {self.roll}, Marks: {self.marks}")

class Teacher(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, age, subject, experience):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.subject = subject
        self.experience = experience
    def display_teacher(self):
        self.display_person()
        print(f"Subject: {self.subject}, Experience: {self.experience} years")

# Testing
s = Student("Amit", 20, 1, 85)
t = Teacher("Sara", 35, "Math", 10)
s.display_student()
t.display_teacher()
```

---

## 30. Explain Method overriding with an example. (5)

- **Method Overriding:** When a child class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.

**Example:**
```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Animal speaks")
class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("Dog barks")

d = Dog()
d.speak()  # Output: Dog barks
```
> "Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method."

---

## 31. Which special method is automatically called to create objects in Python? What does self keyword represent? (2+2)

- The `__init__` method is automatically called to create objects (constructor).

  ```
- `upper()`: Converts all characters to uppercase.
  ```python
  print("hello".upper())  # HELLO
  ```
- `lower()`: Converts all characters to lowercase.
  ```python
  print("HELLO".lower())  # hello
  ```
- `startswith()`: Checks if string starts with a specified value.
  ```python
  print("hello".startswith("he"))  # True
  ```
- `endswith()`: Checks if string ends with a specified value.
  ```python
  print("hello".endswith("lo"))  # True
  ```

---

## 35. Differentiate between list aliasing and list cloning with example. (5)

- **List Aliasing:** Assigning a list to another variable creates an alias, both refer to the same list.
  ```python
  a = [1, 2, 3]
  b = a
  b[0] = 10
  print(a)  # [10, 2, 3]
  ```
- **List Cloning:** Creating a copy of the list so that changes in one do not affect the other.
  ```python
  a = [1, 2, 3]
  b = a[:]
  b[0] = 10
  print(a)  # [1, 2, 3]
  print(b)  # [10, 2, 3]
  ```
> "Aliasing means both variables point to the same list, cloning creates a new list."

---

## 36. Write a program that uses list comprehension to create a list which contains sum of squares of one even number and one odd number where the even number will come from the numbers 1 to 5 and the odd number will come from the numbers 6 to 10. (5)

stack.append(20)
stack.append(30)
print("Stack after pushes:", stack)
# Pop
print("Popped element:", stack.pop())
print("Stack after pop:", stack)
```
> "A stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure."

---

## 39. Implement a QUEUE using a list. (5)

**Program:**
```python
queue = []
# Enqueue
queue.append(10)
queue.append(20)
queue.append(30)

  ```python
  lst = [1, 2]
  lst.append(3)
  print(lst)  # [1, 2, 3]
  ```
- `insert()`: Inserts an element at a specified position.
  ```python

  print(lst)  # [1, 5, 2, 3]
  ```
- `remove()`: Removes the first occurrence of a value.
  ```python
  lst.remove(5)
  print(lst)  # [1, 2, 3]
  ```
- `count()`: Returns the number of times a value appears.

  ```
- `extend()`: Adds all elements of an iterable to the end of the list.
  ```python
  lst.extend([4, 5])
  print(lst)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  ```
- `index()`: Returns the index of the first occurrence of a value.
  ```python
  print(lst.index(3))  # 2
  ```

---

## 45. Difference between del(), pop() and remove(). (3)

- `del()`: Deletes an element at a specific index or deletes the entire list.
- `pop()`: Removes and returns an element at a given index (default is last).
- `remove()`: Removes the first occurrence of a value.

> "`del` is for index or whole list, `pop` returns the value, `remove` is for value."

---

## 46. Difference between sort() and sorted(). (3)

- `sort()`: Sorts the list in place and returns None.
- `sorted()`: Returns a new sorted list from the elements of any iterable.

> "Use `sort()` to modify the original list, `sorted()` to keep the original unchanged."

---

## 47. Difference between list and tuple. (3)

- **List:** Mutable, can be changed after creation, uses square brackets [].
- **Tuple:** Immutable, cannot be changed after creation, uses parentheses ().

> "Lists are mutable, tuples are immutable."

---

**Program:**
```python
lst = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
unique_lst = list(set(lst))
print(unique_lst)
```
> "Using set() removes duplicates but does not preserve order."

---

## 50. Write a program that creates a list of ten random integers. Then create two lists- Odd list and even list that has all odd and even values in the list respectively. (5)

**Program:**
```python
import random
lst = [random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(10)]
odds = [x for x in lst if x % 2 != 0]
evns = [x for x in lst if x % 2 == 0]
print("Original list:", lst)
print("Odd list:", odds)
print("Even list:", evns)
```

---

## 51. State the enumerate () function with an example. (3)

- `enumerate()` adds a counter to an iterable and returns it as an enumerate object.
  ```python
  lst = ['a', 'b', 'c']
  for index, value in enumerate(lst):
      print(index, value)
  # Output: 0 a  1 b  2 c
  ```

---

## 52. State with an example how zip() function works. (3)

- `zip()` combines two or more iterables (lists, tuples, etc.) element-wise.
  ```python
  questions = ["Name", "Age"]
  answers = ["Amit", 20]
  for q, a in zip(questions, answers):
      print(q, ":", a)
  # Output: Name : Amit  Age : 20
  ```

---

## 53. Write a program that has two sequences. First which stores some questions and second stores the corresponding answers. Use the zip() function to form a valid question answer series. (5)

**Program:**
```python

for q, a in zip(questions, answers):
    print(q, a)
```

---

## 54. Describe the following functions with an example a)filter() b)map() c)reduce() [3 mark each]

- `filter()`: Filters elements based on a function.
  ```python
  lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]
  evens = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, lst))
  print(evens)  # [2, 4]
  ```
- `map()`: Applies a function to all elements.
  ```python

  print(a.intersection(b))
  ```
- **Difference:** Elements in one set but not the other.
  ```python
  print(a - b)  # {1, 2}
  print(a.difference(b))
  ```
- **issubset:** Checks if all elements of one set are in another.
  ```python
  print({1, 2}.issubset(a))  # True

---

## 62. State the difference between local and global variables with a snippet of code. (5)

- **Local variable:** Defined inside a function, accessible only within that function.
- **Global variable:** Defined outside all functions, accessible anywhere in the code.

**Example:**
```python
global_var = 10

def func():
    local_var = 5
    print("Local:", local_var)
    print("Global:", global_var)

func()
print("Global outside function:", global_var)
```

---

## 63. Create your own module and use that module in another module to solve a particular problem. (5)

def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```
**main.py:**
```python
from math_utils import add
print(add(3, 4))
```
